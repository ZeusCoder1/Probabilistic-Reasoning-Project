<p style="font-family:Robota;color:black;font-size:28">This work presents a novel approach to predict commodity export values using a Transformer based Monte Carlo Dropout(MCDO) model for handling uncertainity. The model is deployed on a dataset of Indian agricultue exports from 2018 to 2023. By combining the Transformer architecture and MCDO, the expected goal is to capture the complex temporal patterns in export data while providing uncertainity estimates for the predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error. Finally the highest predictions are identified.</p>
